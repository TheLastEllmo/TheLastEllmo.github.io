<p> <img src="Assets/Bedford-Northampton.jpg" align="left">The English Regional Transport Association (ERTA) is a voluntary membership-based, pro-public transport improvement association with its main projects initially in the Bedfordshire and surrounding regional areas. Several of its projects have a nation-wide positive benefit and impact. Membership is open to all. It firmly supports an Ampthill Station being put back on the railway map and sees Luton Airport-Ampthill/CentreParcs-Bedford-Northampton/University Campus by one Thameslink train, as informative of an arc and Luton-Northampton M1 end-to-end, offering a comprehensive joined up rail alternative with no need to change, saving time and money.<br>
<br>
Also Oxford-Bedford-Northampton/Cambridge could be possible freeing up capacity on the West Coast Main Line for passenger and freight workings. We need a renaissance in more freight by rail and decluttering our roads. This is best done by small projects which grow incrementally in a framework and industry which wants growth and is allowed by Government. Scotlandâ€™s rail links have been progressively reopened and Wales is also seeing new lines like Ebbw Vale restored to a full passenger service after many years dormant. So why not the English Regions? East-West Rail should be one of a top 10 per region, not a one-off for the whole of England! Please join ERTA and help strengthen our efforts to bring about changes, advocate schemes and engage where necessary processes for changes for the better. <br>
<br>
As an independent, voluntary association we rely on a growing membership to help us pay the way, invest in our campaigning work and maintain a network of activists who seek to forward our goals. Members get regular newsletters keeping them abreast of progress, news and outlaying opportunities to get involved, engage and be actively playing a part to make the most of any opportunities which come our way.<br>
<br>
On behalf of ERTA I warmly welcome you to the association.</p>
